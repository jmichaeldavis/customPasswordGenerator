## Notes 
I accidentally messed up my Git Repository. It wasn't updating online and then it was having me do a massive merge of two completely different repositories. So, I ended up just creating a new repository and copying the files into it. Unfortunately, I now don't have all my commits available for review.
## Collaboration
I worked on this entire project with Carly Staheli and Kyle Jones.
